## üìù How It Works

1. **List Property:**  
   Users upload property documents via the web interface.
2. **Government Verification:**  
   Documents are verified through government APIs (e.g., DigiLocker).
3. **Blockchain Registration:**  
   Verified properties are registered as NFTs/tokens on Polygon via smart contracts.
4. **Secure Transactions:**  
   Ownership transfers and transactions are automated and recorded on-chain.
5. **Integrated Services:**  
   Access mortgage, legal, and insurance services within the platform.
6. **Virtual Tours:**  
   Buyers can view properties virtually or schedule physical visits.

## üí° Example Smart Contract (Solidity)

```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract PropertyRegistry {
    struct Property {
        uint256 id;
        address owner;
        string documentHash;
        bool verified;
    }
    mapping(uint256 => Property) public properties;

    function registerProperty(uint256 _id, string memory _hash) public {
        properties[_id] = Property(_id, msg.sender, _hash, false);
    }

    function verifyProperty(uint256 _id) public onlyGov {
        properties[_id].verified = true;
    }

    function transferProperty(uint256 _id, address newOwner) public {
        require(properties[_id].owner == msg.sender, "Not the owner");
        require(properties[_id].verified, "Not verified");
        properties[_id].owner = newOwner;
    }

    modifier onlyGov() {
        // Add logic for government authority
        _;
    }
}
```
